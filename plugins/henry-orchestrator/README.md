### Hook Customization

Edit `hooks/hooks.json` to customize hook behavior:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/test-coverage-check.sh",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Bundle Size Limits

Configure bundle size thresholds in `hooks/bundle-size-config.json`:

```json
{
  "web": { "warning": 200, "error": 250 },
  "mobile": { "warning": 20, "error": 25 },
  "game": { "warning": 100, "error": 150 }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Showing Up

```bash
# Verify plugin is enabled in Claude Code settings
# Restart Claude Code session
# Check that command files exist in plugins/henry-orchestrator/commands/
```

### Hooks Not Running

```bash
# Check hooks.json syntax
# Verify script permissions
chmod +x plugins/henry-orchestrator/hooks/scripts/*.sh

# Check hook logs in Claude Code output
```

### Agent Not Being Selected

```bash
# Agents auto-select based on task context
# You can explicitly invoke an agent by name
# Use /henry-team to see recommended agents for your task
```

### Path References

All internal paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for portability:

```json
{
  "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/security-scan.sh"
}
```

This ensures the plugin works regardless of installation location.

## Best Practices

### 1. Let Auto-Selection Work
- Commands automatically select appropriate agents and skills
- Trust the orchestration logic for complex workflows
- Override only when you need specific expertise

### 2. Use Specific Commands
- Use targeted commands (`/henry-web`, `/henry-mobile`) for focused tasks
- Use `/henry-feature` for comprehensive end-to-end workflows
- Use `/help` to discover the right command for your task

### 3. Leverage Hooks
- Hooks provide real-time quality feedback
- Don't disable hooks unless necessary
- Adjust thresholds in config files rather than disabling

### 4. Review Automated Changes
- Auto-formatting and optimization hooks modify code
- Review changes before committing
- Use git to track hook-generated changes

## Contributing

### Extending the Plugin

**Add a new command:**
1. Create `commands/henry-newfeature.md` with YAML frontmatter
2. Command auto-discovers on next session

**Add a new agent:**
1. Create `agents/specialized-expert.md` with description
2. Agent becomes available immediately

**Add a new skill:**
1. Create `skills/new-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Skill auto-activates when description matches task

**Add a new hook:**
1. Add hook configuration to `hooks/hooks.json`
2. Create script in `hooks/scripts/` if needed
3. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for all paths
