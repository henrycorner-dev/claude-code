# App Store Optimization (ASO) Strategies

This document provides detailed strategies and techniques for optimizing app visibility and conversion in app stores.

## Keyword Research & Optimization

### Understanding App Store Search

**iOS App Store:**

- App Name (30 chars): Most weight
- Subtitle (30 chars): High weight
- Keyword Field (100 chars): Medium weight (not visible to users)
- App Description: Not indexed for search

**Google Play Store:**

- App Title (30 chars): Most weight
- Short Description (80 chars): High weight
- Full Description (4000 chars): Medium weight, all indexed
- Developer Name: Indexed

### Keyword Research Process

**1. Brainstorm Seed Keywords**

- Core functionality keywords
- Problem keywords (what problem does app solve?)
- Category keywords
- Competitor keywords
- Feature keywords

**2. Expand Keyword List**

- Use keyword research tools
- Analyze competitor keywords
- Look at "People Also Search For"
- Check auto-complete suggestions
- Consider long-tail keywords

**3. Analyze Keywords**

- Search volume (how many searches)
- Competition level (how many apps target it)
- Relevance to your app
- Difficulty score
- Conversion potential

**4. Prioritize Keywords**

- High volume + low competition = best opportunities
- High relevance + high volume = priority targets
- Long-tail keywords = easier to rank, lower volume
- Branded keywords = protect your brand

**5. Track Rankings**

- Monitor keyword positions weekly
- Track competitor rankings
- Measure keyword performance
- Adjust strategy based on results

### Keyword Optimization Techniques

**App Name/Title (iOS/Android)**

- Include primary keyword
- Front-load most important terms
- Balance branding with discoverability
- Use subtitle/short description for secondary keywords
- Format: "Brand Name - Primary Keyword"
- Example: "Headspace - Meditation & Sleep"

**iOS Subtitle (30 chars)**

- Highlight key value proposition
- Include 1-2 important keywords
- Clear and compelling
- Example: "Meditation Made Simple"

**iOS Keyword Field (100 chars)**

- Comma-separated, no spaces
- No need to repeat words from title/subtitle
- Singular/plural: include both if space allows
- No competitor names (Apple rejects)
- Use all 100 characters
- Example: "mindfulness,relax,calm,anxiety,stress,yoga,breathe,zen,wellness"

**Android Short Description (80 chars)**

- Include primary keywords naturally
- Clear value proposition
- Compelling call to action
- Readable, not keyword-stuffed

**Android Full Description (4000 chars)**

- Natural keyword placement (5-7 times for primary)
- Keyword density: 2-3% for primary keywords
- Semantic variations and synonyms
- Structured with headers and bullets
- Front-load important keywords in first 250 characters
- Include long-tail keyword phrases

### Keyword Best Practices

**Do:**

- Use exact match keywords
- Include relevant synonyms
- Consider user intent
- Test different keyword combinations
- Update keywords based on performance
- Use localized keywords for each market

**Don't:**

- Keyword stuff
- Use competitor brand names
- Repeat keywords unnecessarily
- Use irrelevant keywords
- Use trademark violations
- Ignore search trends

### Keyword Performance Metrics

**Track These Metrics:**

- Keyword ranking position
- Search impression share
- Tap-through rate (TTR) from search
- Conversion rate per keyword
- Total downloads attributed to keyword

**Optimization Cycle:**

1. Monitor rankings weekly
2. Identify underperforming keywords
3. Test alternative keywords
4. Measure impact after 2-3 weeks
5. Iterate and refine

## App Listing Optimization

### App Name/Title Strategy

**iOS (30 characters):**

- Format options:
  - "Brand - Primary Keyword" (most common)
  - "Brand: Value Proposition"
  - "Primary Keyword - Brand"
- Consider A/B testing different formats

- All characters indexed for search
- Avoid special characters if possible

### Visual Assets Optimization

**App Icon:**

- Simple, recognizable at small sizes
- Unique in category
- Represents app purpose
- High contrast for visibility
- Test multiple versions
- Consider cultural differences per market

**Screenshots (iOS: 10 max, Android: 8 max):**

- First 2-3 are critical (above fold on most devices)
- Portrait orientation for phones
- Show key features and benefits
- Use captions/overlay text
- Tell a story or flow
- Highlight unique value proposition
- Include social proof (ratings, testimonials)
- Keep text readable (large fonts)
- Use actual app UI
- Localize for each market

**Screenshot Best Practices:**

1. Hero shot first (most compelling feature)
2. Show problem > solution flow
3. Highlight social proof
4. Demonstrate ease of use
5. Show results/outcomes
6. Include comparison (before/after)
7. Last shot: Call to action

**App Preview Video (iOS: 30 sec, Android: 30 sec):**

- Link to privacy policy and terms

**Structure:**

1. Hook (problem/solution) - 1-2 sentences
2. Key benefits - 3-5 bullets
3. Main features - detailed list
4. Social proof - ratings, awards, press
5. Additional information - support, privacy
6. Call to action

**Android Description (4000 chars):**

- Fully indexed for search
