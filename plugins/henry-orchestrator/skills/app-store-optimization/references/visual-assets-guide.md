# Visual Assets Guide for App Store Optimization

This document provides detailed specifications, best practices, and design strategies for app store visual assets.

## App Icon Design

### Technical Specifications

**iOS App Store:**
- Size: 1024x1024 px (submitted in App Store Connect)
- Format: PNG or JPEG (no transparency)
- Color space: RGB
- No rounded corners (iOS applies automatically)
- Actual displayed sizes: 60x60, 76x76, 120x120, 152x152, 180x180

**Google Play Store:**
- Size: 512x512 px
- Format: PNG (32-bit, transparency allowed)
- Maximum file size: 1024 KB
- Actual displayed sizes: 48x48dp to 192x192dp

### Design Best Practices

**Core Principles:**
1. **Simplicity** - Recognizable at small sizes
2. **Uniqueness** - Stand out from competitors
3. **Relevance** - Represent app purpose
4. **Scalability** - Clear at all sizes
5. **Memorability** - Easy to remember

**Design Guidelines:**
- Use bold, simple shapes
- High contrast for visibility
- Limit to 2-3 colors
- Avoid text (if necessary, keep minimal)
- Center the primary element
- Avoid detailed imagery
- Consider cultural meanings of colors/symbols
- Test in grayscale for contrast

**Common Mistakes:**
- Too much detail
- Low contrast
- Too many elements
- Text that's unreadable at small sizes
- Copying competitor designs
- Platform inconsistency (use same icon for both)

**Category-Specific Trends:**
- **Social:** People-focused, vibrant colors
- **Productivity:** Clean, professional, tool-like
- **Games:** Character or game element, energetic
- **Health/Fitness:** Active, motivational
- **Finance:** Trust signals, professional
- **Education:** Friendly, accessible

### Testing Your Icon

**Test Methods:**
1. View at actual sizes (60x60, 48x48)
2. Place among competitors
3. Convert to grayscale (check contrast)
4. Show to potential users
5. A/B test variations in stores

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is it instantly recognizable?
- Does it stand out in the category?
- Is the purpose clear?
- Is it memorable?
- Does it work at all sizes?

## Screenshots

### Screenshot Content Strategy

**First 3 Screenshots (Critical):**
- These appear "above the fold" on most devices
- Highest impact on conversion
- Show your strongest value proposition
- Most users won't scroll past first 2-3

**Screenshot Order Strategy:**

**Option 1: Feature Flow**
1. Hero/main feature
2. Second key feature
3. Third key feature
4. Supporting features (4-7)
5. Social proof/call to action (last)

**Option 2: Story Flow**
1. Problem statement
2. Solution (your app)
3. How it works
4. Results/benefits
5. Social proof

**Option 3: Benefit-First**
1. Primary benefit/outcome
2. How it's achieved
3. Additional benefits
4. Features that enable benefits
5. Social proof

### Screenshot Design Approaches

**Approach 1: Device Frames with UI**
- Show actual app in device mockup
- Add text overlays for context
- Clean, professional look
- Good for: Complex apps, productivity apps

**Approach 2: UI with Text Overlays**
- No device frame, full screen UI
- Large text captions
- Highlights specific features
- Good for: Most app categories

**Approach 3: Lifestyle/Contextual**

- Focus on concept/benefits
- Good for: Games, creative apps, unique concepts

### Screenshot Text Overlays

**Text Best Practices:**
- Font size: Large enough to read at preview size (minimum 40pt)
- Contrast: High contrast with background
- Brevity: 5-10 words maximum
- Placement: Top or bottom third (avoid center where UI is)
- Hierarchy: Large headline, optional smaller supporting text
- Consistency: Same typography across all screenshots

**Caption Examples:**

**Feature-focused:**
- "Track Your Progress Daily"
- "Connect with Friends Instantly"
- "Schedule Posts in Seconds"

**Benefit-focused:**
- "Save 10 Hours Every Week"
